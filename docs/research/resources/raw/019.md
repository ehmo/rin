The widespread TikTok-ification of all social apps is quite striking (and sad!) Literally, all apps (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, etc) have become one click away to an infinite stream of viral videos, playing non-stop. The ratio of mindless consumption to building something meaningful on computing devices now likely exceeds 10:1, and may even be closer to 50:1.
