“In our studies, something like almost 40% of young people, when they’re looking for a place for lunch, they don’t go to Google Maps or Search. They go to TikTok”
at a technology conference in July 2022…

Prabhakar Raghavan, a Google senior vice president

“TikTok’s results ‘don’t seem as biased’ as Google’s .. [I] often want a different opinion from what ads and websites optimized for Google say.”

TikTok is not just a young person’s game


78% of Gen Z and Millennials say they have learned a lot from content created by
people                           older than them.

“Your weak ties connect you to networks that are outside of your own circle. They give you information and ideas that you otherwise would not have gotten.” - Stanford sociologist Mark Granovetter




“When it comes to Substack, I think the theory of ‘strength in weak ties’ really holds up. This is a chat of people I don’t know, yet am bonded with through a shared interest in each other’s taste. We can be objective due to that degree of separation, which is something I am not afforded on Instagram or even a group chat with friends.”
https://www.voguebusiness.com/story/consumers/to-escape-the-algorithm-fashion-girls-are-shopping-via-substack

Figuring out how to make the most of Substack — be it via sponsored partnerships with creators or launching their own — is less clear [for brands]. With the increase in migration from other social media platforms to Substack largely due how untouched the space feels, it’s important for any brand that wants to engage do so with care.

 niche social media spaces refers to the deep, authentic relationships formed through shared interests, fostering higher user engagement and loyalty compared to broader platforms​






platforms supporting
beyond platform



“It’s giving Discord, but for the girls”- Terry Nguyen, Internet Culture Writer
Anyone can set up a “home”, and invite members (friends, followers, etc.) to discuss the room’s topic. Ex: Book clubs, creator-led communities, sororities, run clubs and brand ambassador programmes are a few examples of the kinds of “homes” that exist on Geneva.

“While an Instagram DM is great, it’s too much, you can’t catch up. We really love the features that Geneva [has] where … you could have different rooms for different topics. That helps us to better serve our community and as we’re monitoring it and responding, it’s much easier from a UX perspective.”- Ashley Murphy, Rare Beauty senior director of consumer marketing

COMPONENTS OF TASTE

culture
audience
social-ness



Reminder that “Best Practices” are often a bit of a moving target that shift with consumer behaviour or measurement principles, so continue to push (with support) executions that break the mold 



Don’t think about someone seeing your content twice
Think about more people seeing it for the first time

Create with longtail pickup in mind

More assets = More Frequency = More time for an idea to catch.Remember “quality” is a subjective term, think about the content you’ve seen and shared.
