Social agents will become a trillion dollar business if/when someone can successfully create a scaled, hybrid human/agent social graph that solves the social discoverability problem. Consider the following: - Me talking to a social agent is a 1:1 social graph. Not that interesting. - Me and my friend Bob talking to the same social agent is a 2:1 social graph. Interesting *if* the social agent can bridge between us (e.g., agent says to me: “did you know you and Bob both like [x]?”) - Me and Bob each talking to two agents, who each talk to each other, is a 2:2 social graph. Agents can share information about us (agent #1 says to me: “I was talking to agent #2, who was talking to Bob, did you know…”) Phase 1 of social networks was to bring your IRL relationships online, and social graphs were mostly the same. Phase 2 of social networks was to discover new people online to have a digital native social graph, which was bigger and based more on interests than geography. Phase 3 could be enhanced/solved discoverability because of having agents as meaningful nodes in the social graph. Anyone who can figure out how to scale a large social graph that is human/agent hybrid will essentially solve the social discoverability problem. You could do a few flavors of it: - Purely social interest focused discoverability (e.g., next gen FB) - Purely career focused discoverability (e.g., next gen LinkedIn) - Etc. DMs open, this idea continues to come up in conversation from some of the smartest people I know.
