Title: River - Makina on X: "I want a friend CRM

Just a place I can keep track of cool people I’ve met, my history with them, who they’re connected to, see what they’re up to nowadays, and be able to instantly msg them or invite them to events.

No it’s not LinkedIn or Twitter. I don’t want the bullshit" / X

I want a friend CRM Just a place I can keep track of cool people I’ve met, my history with them, who they’re connected to, see what they’re up to nowadays, and be able to instantly msg them or invite them to events. No it’s not LinkedIn or Twitter. I don’t want the bullshit content that comes along with it. Just the person, network, and history. Who’s building this?
