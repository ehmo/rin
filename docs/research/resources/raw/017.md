As I get older, I realize it's a huge bummer that we collectively decided in our early 20s that Facebook was uncool It's the one place where I added everyone I knew in real life, and it would be a great way to stay in touch now I want to know when friends go through big moments like getting married, changing careers, falling sick, and having kids. But my social graph is scattered across the globe, so there isn't really a natural touchpoint to know those things
