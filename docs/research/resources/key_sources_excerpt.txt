The widespread TikTok-ification of all social apps is quite striking (and sad!) Literally, all apps (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, etc) have become one click away to an infinite stream of viral videos, playing non-stop. The ratio of mindless consumption to building something meaningful on computing devices now likely exceeds 10:1, and may even be closer to 50:1.

On my trip to Nice, France I joined a group to do a day trip to Monaco and it was amazing, probably wouldn't of went if I was alone.  ![Image 64](https://framerusercontent.com/images/WNMmEUClyaAn6ljcbhK95lWJ4I8.jpg?width=736&height=842)  Alessio M.

Social agents will become a trillion dollar business if/when someone can successfully create a scaled, hybrid human/agent social graph that solves the social discoverability problem. Consider the following: - Me talking to a social agent is a 1:1 social graph. Not that interesting. - Me and my friend Bob talking to the same social agent is a 2:1 social graph. Interesting *if* the social agent can bridge between us (e.g., agent says to me: “did you know you and Bob both like [x]?”) - Me and Bob each talking to two agents, who each talk to each other, is a 2:2 social graph. Agents can share information about us (agent #1 says to me: “I was talking to agent #2, who was talking to Bob, did you know…”) Phase 1 of social networks was to bring your IRL relationships online, and social graphs were mostly the same. Phase 2 of social networks was to discover new people online to have a digital native social graph, which was bigger and based more on interests than geography. Phase 3 could be enhanced/solved discoverability because of having agents as meaningful nodes in the social graph. Anyone who can figure out how to scale a large social graph that is human/agent hybrid will essentially solve the social discoverability problem. You could do a few flavors of it: - Purely social interest focused discoverability (e.g., next gen FB) - Purely career focused discoverability (e.g., next gen LinkedIn) - Etc. DMs open, this idea continues to come up in conversation from some of the smartest people I know.

# Breaking the Sorting Barrier for Directed Single-Source Shortest Paths 

Ran Duan ∗ Jiayi Mao ∗ Xiao Mao † Xinkai Shu ‡ Longhui Yin ∗

July 31, 2025 

Abstract 

We give a deterministic O(m log 2/3 n)-time algorithm for single-source shortest paths (SSSP) on directed graphs with real non-negative edge weights in the comparison-addition model. This is the first result to break the O(m + n log n) time bound of Dijkstra’s algorithm on sparse graphs, showing that Dijkstra’s algorithm is not optimal for SSSP. 

# 1 Introduction 

In an m-edge n-vertex directed graph G = ( V, E ) with a non-negative weight function w : E → R≥0,single-source shortest path (SSSP) considers the lengths of the shortest paths from a source vertex s to all 

v ∈ V . Designing faster algorithms for SSSP is one of the most fundamental problems in graph theory, with exciting improvements since the 50s. The textbook Dijkstra’s algorithm [Dij59], combined with advanced data structures such as the Fibonacci heap [FT87] or the relaxed heap [DGST88], solves SSSP in O(m+n log n) time. It works in the comparison-addition model, natural for real-number inputs, where only comparison and addition operations on edge weights are allowed, and each operation consumes unit time. For undirected graphs, Pettie and Ramachan-dran [PR05] proposed a hierarchy-based algorithm which runs in O(mα (m, n ) + min {n log n, n log log r})

time in the comparison-addition model, where α is the inverse-Ackermann function and r bounds the ratio between any two edge weights. Dijkstra’s algorithm also produces an ordering of vertices by distances from the source as a byproduct. A recent contribution by Haeupler, Hladík, Rozhoň, Tarjan and Tětek [HHR +24] showed that Dijkstra’s algorithm is optimal if we require the algorithm to output the order of vertices by distances. If only the distances and not the ordering are required, a recent result by Duan, Mao, Shu and Yin [DMSY23] provided an O(m√log n log log n)-time randomized SSSP algorithm for undirected graphs, better than O(n log n) in sparse graphs. However it remains to break such a sorting barrier in directed graphs. 

1.1 Our results 

In this paper, we present the first SSSP algorithm for directed real-weighted graphs that breaks the sorting bottleneck on sparse graphs. 

Theorem 1.1. There exists a deterministic algorithm that takes O(m log 2/3(n)) time to solve the single-source shortest path problem on directed graphs with real non-negative edge weights.

Note that the algorithm in [DMSY23] is randomized, thus our result is also the first deterministic algo-rithm to break such O(m + n log n) time bound even in undirected graphs. 

Technical Overview. Broadly speaking, there are two traditional algorithms for solving the single-source shortest path problem: 

• Dijkstra’s algorithm [Dij59]: via a priority queue, it each time extracts a vertex u with the minimum distance from the source, and from u relaxes its outgoing edges. It typically sorts vertices by their distances from the source, resulting in a time complexity of at least Θ( n log n).

• Bellman-Ford algorithm [Bel58]: based on dynamic programming, it relaxes all edges for several steps. For finding shortest paths with at most k edges, the Bellman-Ford algorithm can achieve this in 

O(mk ) time without requiring sorting. Our approach merges these two methods through a recursive partitioning technique, similar to those used in bottleneck path algorithms as described in [GT88, CKT +16, DLWX18]. At any point during the execution of the Dijkstra’s algorithm, the priority queue (heap) maintains a “fron-tier” S of vertices such that if a vertex u is “incomplete” — if the current distance estimate bd[u] is still greater than the true distance d(u) — the shortest s-u path must visit some complete vertex v ∈ S. In this case, we say u is “dependent” on v ∈ S. (However, vertices in S are not guaranteed to be all complete.) The Dijkstra’s algorithm simply picks the vertex in S closest to source, which must be complete, and then relaxes all edges from that vertex. The running time bottleneck comes from the fact that sometimes the frontier may contain Θ( n) vertices. Since we constantly need to pick the vertex closest to source, we essentially need to maintain a total order between a large number of vertices, and are thus unable to break the Ω( n log n) sorting barrier. Our most essential idea is a way to reduce the size of the frontier. Suppose we want to compute all distances that are less than some upper bound B. Let eU be the set of vertices u with d(u) < B and the shortest s-u path visits a vertex in S. It is possible to limit the size of our frontier |S| to | eU |/ log Ω(1) (n), or 1/ log Ω(1) (n) of the vertices of interest. Given a parameter k = log Ω(1) (n), there are two possible cases: 

• If | eU | > k |S|, then our frontier already has size | eU |/k ;

• Otherwise, suppose | eU | ≤ k|S|. By running Bellman-Ford step k times from vertices in S, every vertex u ∈ eU whose shortest s-u path containing < k vertices in eU is complete. Otherwise the vertex 

v ∈ S which u is dependent on must have a shortest path tree rooted at it with ≥ k vertices in eU , so we can shrink the frontier S to the set of “pivots”, each of which has a shortest path tree of size ≥ k,and the number of such pivots is bounded by | eU |/k .Our algorithm is based on the idea above, but instead of using a Dijkstra-like method where the frontier is dynamic and thus intractable, we use a divide-and-conquer procedure that consists of log n/t levels, each containing a set of frontier vertices and an upper bound B, such that a naive implementation would still spend 

Θ( t) time per frontier vertex and the running time would remain Θ(log n) per vertex. We can however apply the aforementioned frontier reduction on each level so that the Θ( t) work only applies to the pivots, about 

1/ log Ω(1) (n) of the frontier vertices. Thus the running time per vertex gets reduced to log n/ log Ω(1) (n),which is a significant speedup. 

1.2 Related Works 

For the SSSP problem, if we allow the algorithm to run in the word RAM model with integer edge weights, a sequence of improvements beyond O(n log n) [FW93, FW94, Tho00a, Ram96, Ram97, Tho00b, Hag00] cul-minated in Thorup’s linear-time algorithm for undirected graphs [Tho99] and O(m + n log log min {n, C })

2time for directed graphs [Tho04], where C is the maximum edge weight. For graphs with negative weights, recent breakthrough results include near-linear time O(m1+ o(1) log C) algorithms for SSSP with negative in-teger weights [CKL +22, BNWN22, BCF23], and strongly subcubic time algorithm for SSSP with negative real weights [Fin24, HJQ24]. Based on the lower bound of Ω( n log n) for comparison-based sorting algorithms, it was generally believed that such sorting barrier exists for SSSP and many similar problems. Researchers have broken such a sorting barrier for many graph problems. For example, Yao [Yao75] gave a minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm with running time O(m log log n), which is further improved to randomized linear time [KKT95]. Gabow and Tarjan [GT88] solves s-t bottleneck path problem in O(m log ∗ n)-time, later im-proved to randomized O(mβ (m, n )) time [CKT +16], where β(m, n ) = min {k ≥ 1 : log (k) n ≤ mn }.For the single-source all-destination bottleneck path problem, there is a randomized O(m√log n)-time al-gorithm by Duan, Lyu, Wu and Xie [DLWX18]. For the single-source nondecreasing path problem, Virginia V.Williams [Wil10] proposed an algorithm with a time bound of O(m log log n).

# 2 Preliminaries 

We consider a directed graph G = ( V, E ) with a non-negative weight function w : E → R≥0, also denoted by wuv for each edge (u, v ) ∈ E. Let n = |V |, m = |E| be the number of vertices and edges in the graph. In the single-source shortest path problem, we assume there is a source vertex in the graph denoted by s. The goal of our algorithm is to find the length of shortest path from s to every vertex v ∈ V , denoted by d(v).Without loss of generality, we assume that every vertex in G is reachable from s, so m ≥ n − 1.

Constant-Degree Graph. In this paper we assume that the algorithm works on a graph with constant in-degrees and out-degrees. For any given graph G we may construct G′ by a classical transformation (similar to [Fre83]) to accomplish this: 

• Substitute each vertex v with a cycle of vertices strongly connected with zero-weight edges. For every incoming or outgoing neighbor w of v, there is a vertex xvw on this cycle. 

• For every edge (u, v ) in G, add a directed edge from vertex xuv to xvu with weight wuv .It’s clear that the shortest path is preserved by the transformation. Each vertex in G′ has in-degree and out-degree at most 2, while G′ being a graph with O(m) vertices and O(m) edges. 

Comparison-Addition Model. Our algorithm works under the comparison-addition model, where all edge weights are subject to only comparison and addition operations. In this model, each addition and comparison takes unit time, and no other computations on edge weights are allowed. 

Labels Used in the Algorithm. For a vertex v ∈ V , denote d(u) as the length of shortest path from s to u
