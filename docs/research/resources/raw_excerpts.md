As I get older, I realize it's a huge bummer that we collectively decided in our early 20s that Facebook was uncool It's the one place where I added everyone I knew in real life, and it would be a great way to stay in touch now I want to know when friends go through big moments like getting married, changing careers, falling sick, and having kids. But my social graph is scattered across the globe, so there isn't really a natural touchpoint to know those things

Social agents will become a trillion dollar business if/when someone can successfully create a scaled, hybrid human/agent social graph that solves the social discoverability problem. Consider the following: - Me talking to a social agent is a 1:1 social graph. Not that interesting. - Me and my friend Bob talking to the same social agent is a 2:1 social graph. Interesting *if* the social agent can bridge between us (e.g., agent says to me: “did you know you and Bob both like [x]?”) - Me and Bob each talking to two agents, who each talk to each other, is a 2:2 social graph. Agents can share information about us (agent #1 says to me: “I was talking to agent #2, who was talking to Bob, did you know…”) Phase 1 of social networks was to bring your IRL relationships online, and social graphs were mostly the same. Phase 2 of social networks was to discover new people online to have a digital native social graph, which was bigger and based more on interests than geography. Phase 3 could be enhanced/solved discoverability because of having agents as meaningful nodes in the social graph. Anyone who can figure out how to scale a large social graph that is human/agent hybrid will essentially solve the social discoverability problem. You could do a few flavors of it: - Purely social interest focused discoverability (e.g., next gen FB) - Purely career focused discoverability (e.g., next gen LinkedIn) - Etc. DMs open, this idea continues to come up in conversation from some of the smartest people I know.

# Breaking the Sorting Barrier for Directed Single-Source Shortest Paths 

Ran Duan ∗ Jiayi Mao ∗ Xiao Mao † Xinkai Shu ‡ Longhui Yin ∗

July 31, 2025 

Abstract 

We give a deterministic O(m log 2/3 n)-time algorithm for single-source shortest paths (SSSP) on directed graphs with real non-negative edge weights in the comparison-addition model. This is the first result to break the O(m + n log n) time bound of Dijkstra’s algorithm on sparse graphs, showing that Dijkstra’s algorithm is not optimal for SSSP. 

# 1 Introduction 

In an m-edge n-vertex directed graph G = ( V, E ) with a non-negative weight function w : E → R≥0,single-source shortest path (SSSP) considers the lengths of the shortest paths from a source vertex s to all 

v ∈ V . Designing faster algorithms for SSSP is one of the most fundamental problems in graph theory, with exciting improvements since the 50s. The textbook Dijkstra’s algorithm [Dij59], combined with advanced data structures such as the Fibonacci heap [FT87] or the relaxed heap [DGST88], solves SSSP in O(m+n log n) time. It works in the comparison-addition model, natural for real-number inputs, where only comparison and addition operations on edge weights are allowed, and each operation consumes unit time. For undirected graphs, Pettie and Ramachan-dran [PR05] proposed a hierarchy-based algorithm which runs in O(mα (m, n ) + min {n log n, n log log r})

time in the comparison-addition model, where α is the inverse-Ackermann function and r bounds the ratio between any two edge weights. Dijkstra’s algorithm also produces an ordering of vertices by distances from the source as a byproduct. A recent contribution by Haeupler, Hladík, Rozhoň, Tarjan and Tětek [HHR +24] showed that Dijkstra’s algorithm is optimal if we require the algorithm to output the order of vertices by distances. If only the distances and not the ordering are required, a recent result by Duan, Mao, Shu and Yin [DMSY23] provided an O(m√log n log log n)-time randomized SSSP algorithm for undirected graphs, better than O(n log n) in sparse graphs. However it remains to break such a sorting barrier in directed graphs.
