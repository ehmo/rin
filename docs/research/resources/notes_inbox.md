## Engagement Scenarios

Two users, U1 and U2 partial connected through their contact list (U1 has U2 but not vice versa).
- When U1 has U2 contact, but U2 doesn’t, it’s considered a draw.
- If U2 adds U1, it will draw if they are the same circle or lose depends on how far the circle is (weight 0.1 per circle distance)

Two users, U1 and U2 connected through their contact list.
- Same as above, depends on which circle they are added to.

Two users, U1 and U2 are not connected and have no connections.
- U1 sends an invite. If U2 accepts it, then it’s a draw with weight based o the circle. If U2 declines, it’s a loss.
- U1 can only send an invite if the chances of draw are higher than 50%. If they are lower, they have to pay the difference.
