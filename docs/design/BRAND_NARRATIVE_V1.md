# Brand Narrative and Tone Guide V1

## 1) Purpose

Define the brand story, voice, and writing standards for Rin. Every word in the product, marketing, and communications should pass through this guide. If copy doesn't meet these standards, rewrite it until it does.

## 2) Brand Story

### 2.1 The Problem

You have 1,200 contacts. You can't name 50 that matter.

Your phone is a graveyard of half-remembered introductions, duplicated entries, and relationships you meant to maintain but didn't. You met someone important six months ago. You can't find them. You know someone who knows the person you need. You don't know who. A relationship that took years to build went cold because you forgot it existed.

Contacts apps show you a list. LinkedIn shows you a feed. CRMs show you a pipeline. None of them show you the thing that actually matters: the shape and strength of your real relationships.

Your network is decaying in plain sight, and you have no instrument to measure it.

### 2.2 The Belief

Your network is your most valuable professional asset. Not your resume. Not your portfolio. Not your LinkedIn follower count. The actual web of people who know you, trust you, and will take your call.

But an asset you can't see is an asset you can't manage. And a network you don't understand is a network you're slowly losing.

### 2.3 What Rin Does

Rin turns your contact list into a graph. It scores your network strength, surfaces the structure of your relationships, and tells you what's real and what's noise.

Import once. Rin handles deduplication, scoring, and organization. No maintenance. No data entry. No CRM busywork.

The result: you see your network clearly for the first time. You know which relationships are strong, which are fading, and where the gaps are. You act on signal, not memory.

### 2.4 Why Now

People have more contacts than ever and less understanding of them. The average professional's contact list has grown 3x in the past decade. The tools haven't kept up. Contact management is still a list with a search bar. That's not intelligence. That's a filing cabinet.

The graph is the right abstraction. Not a list. Not a feed. Not a pipeline. A graph — where relationships have weight, direction, and structure.

---

## 3) Brand Values

### 3.1 Clarity Over Complexity

Rin takes something messy (your contact list) and makes it legible. The product, the copy, and the design all follow the same principle: remove noise, reveal signal. If something doesn't make the user's network clearer, it doesn't ship.

### 3.2 Respect for Attention

Every notification, every screen, every sentence must earn the user's time. No engagement farming. No dark patterns. No "come back and check your score!" nagging. Rin speaks when it has something worth saying.

### 3.3 Privacy as Architecture

Privacy is not a feature or a marketing claim. It's a structural decision. Three-state access controls, per-field permissions, shadow profiles, no data selling — these aren't add-ons. They're the foundation. Users trust Rin with their most sensitive social data. That trust is non-negotiable.

### 3.4 Substance Over Performance

Rin rewards real network quality, not vanity metrics. The score values mutual connections over bulk additions. The product values depth over surface. The brand values saying something true over saying something impressive.

---

## 4) Positioning Statement

**For** networking professionals who manage hundreds or thousands of contacts, **Rin is** the network intelligence app **that** reveals the strength, structure, and gaps in your real relationships **because** it treats your contacts as a graph — not a list — and scores what matters: quality, reciprocity, and trust.

### 4.1 Category

Network intelligence. Not a contact manager. Not a personal CRM. Not a social network.

A contact manager stores data. A CRM tracks pipeline activity. A social network broadcasts content. Rin does none of these things. It reads the structure of your relationships and tells you what's actually there.

### 4.2 One-Line Descriptions

Use the version appropriate to the context:

| Context | Line |
|---------|------|
| Elevator pitch | "Rin scores your network strength and shows you which relationships actually matter." |
| App Store subtitle | "Your contacts, decoded." |
| Tagline | "Understand your real network." |
| Technical | "Contact-graph intelligence with relationship scoring and smart deduplication." |

## 5) Voice Principles

### 5.1 Every Word Earns Its Place

Cut filler. Cut qualifiers. Cut throat-clearing. If a sentence works without a word, that word shouldn't be there.

Bad: "We're really excited to help you get started on your journey to better understanding your professional network!"
Good: "Let's see what your network looks like."

### 5.2 State Facts, Not Feelings

Rin tells the user what happened, what it means, and what to do next. It doesn't narrate its own emotions. It doesn't say "Yay!" or "Oops!" or "We're sorry." It says what's true.

Bad: "Awesome! We found some duplicates for you!"
Good: "12 duplicates found. Review them."

### 5.3 Confident, Not Arrogant

Rin knows what it does and says so directly. It doesn't hedge with "might" and "maybe" unless genuine uncertainty exists. But it never talks down to users, and it never pretends to be infallible.

Bad: "Your score might possibly indicate some room for potential improvement."
Good: "Your score is 54. Here's how to strengthen it."

### 5.4 Short Sentences. Clear Structure.

The default sentence length is short. When a longer sentence is necessary, it's because the idea requires it — not because the writer was lazy. Use parallel structure. Use lists when there are three or more items. One idea per sentence.

---

## 6) Tone Spectrum

The voice stays constant. The tone adapts to context.

### 6.1 Onboarding

**Tone**: Welcoming, direct, zero friction.

The user just decided to try Rin. Respect that decision by getting them to value fast. No long explanations. No philosophy. Show what Rin does by doing it.

- Lead with action, not explanation.
- Keep screens to one idea each.
- Never say "welcome to Rin" — the user knows where they are.
- Permission requests explain the reason in one sentence, then ask.

### 6.2 Error States

**Tone**: Honest, specific, helpful. Never apologetic.

Errors happen. The user doesn't need sympathy. They need to know what went wrong and what to do about it.

- State what happened.
- State what the user can do.
- Never say "Oops," "Uh oh," or "Something went wrong" without specifics.
- Never blame the user. Never blame the server. Just state the situation.

### 6.3 Empty States

**Tone**: Motivating, practical. Never guilt-tripping.

An empty screen is an opportunity to tell the user what value they'll gain. Don't make them feel bad for not having done something yet. Show them the one action that fills the space.

- Lead with what they'll see once the state is populated.
- Single clear CTA.
- Never say "It's lonely in here" or "Nothing to see yet."

### 6.4 Premium Upsell

**Tone**: Value-driven, factual. Never pushy.

Premium features are shown by describing what they do, not by creating anxiety about missing out. The user decides. Rin presents the facts.

- Describe the feature and its value in one sentence.
- Show the price. No hidden costs.
- Always provide a way to dismiss without friction.
- Never use "unlock," "exclusive," or "limited time."
- Never count down. Never flash. Never nag.

### 6.5 Notifications

**Tone**: Useful, minimal. Never spammy.

Every notification must pass this test: would the user thank Rin for sending it? If not, don't send it.

- Deliver concrete information: "3 new duplicates detected" not "Check out what's new!"
- No re-engagement notifications ("We miss you!").
- No congratulatory notifications ("You hit 100 contacts!").
- Frequency: less is always more.

### 6.6 App Store Description

**Tone**: Compelling, factual, structured.

The App Store listing is a sales page that respects the reader's intelligence. Lead with the value proposition. Use short feature blocks. End with trust signals (privacy, pricing transparency).

- Open with the core insight, not the product name.
- Use bullet points for feature lists.
- Include pricing in the description. No surprises.
- Close with the privacy commitment.

---

## 7) Writing Rules

### 7.1 Sentence Length

- UI copy: 12 words max per sentence. Aim for 8.
- Marketing copy: 20 words max per sentence.
- Descriptions: 25 words max per sentence.
- If you need a comma, consider splitting into two sentences.

### 7.2 Banned Words and Phrases

| Banned | Why | Use Instead |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| "We're excited to..." | Corporate filler | (just state the thing) |
| "Oops" / "Uh oh" / "Whoops" | Infantile | (state what happened) |
| "Journey" | Overused | (be specific about the action) |
| "Unlock" | Manipulative | "Get" or "Use" |
| "Powerful" / "Robust" | Meaningless | (describe the specific capability) |
| "Leverage" | Corporate jargon | "Use" |
| "Game-changer" | Hyperbole | (describe the specific value) |
| "Seamless" / "Seamlessly" | Cliche | (describe the specific experience) |
| "Best-in-class" | Unverifiable | (cite the specific advantage) |
| "World-class" | Unverifiable | (drop it) |
| "Revolutionary" | Hyperbole | (describe what's new) |
| "We miss you" | Manipulative | (don't send re-engagement) |
| "Don't miss out" | FOMO pressure | (describe the value, let them decide) |
| "It's lonely in here" | Guilt-tripping | (describe what will appear) |
| "Smart" / "Intelligent" (as adjectives for Rin's features) | Self-congratulatory | (show the intelligence through results) |
| "Just" (as minimizer) | Undermines the action | (drop it) |
| "Simply" | Condescending | (drop it) |
| "Please" (in UI actions) | Unnecessary deference | (direct instruction) |

### 7.3 Capitalization

- **Screen titles**: Title Case.
- **Button labels**: Title Case for primary actions ("Import Contacts"), sentence case for secondary ("Learn more").
- **Body copy**: Sentence case. Always.
- **Feature names**: Capitalize product-specific proper nouns: Rin Score, Circles, Shadow Profile. Lowercase generic concepts: contacts, dedup, network.
- **Never**: ALL CAPS for emphasis. Use bold or restructure the sentence.

### 7.4 Number Formatting

- Spell out one through nine. Use digits for 10+.
- Always use digits for: scores (72), counts in context (3 duplicates), percentages (84%), prices ($4.99).
- Use commas for thousands: 1,200 contacts.
- Abbreviate large numbers in tight UI: 1.2K, 15K.
- Dates: "Feb 15, 2026" in full, "Feb 15" when year is obvious, "2/15" in compact UI.
- Times: "3:42 PM" or "3 hours ago" — never both.

### 7.5 Punctuation

- No exclamation marks in UI copy. Zero. If the information is exciting, the content conveys that.
- Periods on full sentences. No periods on labels, headings, or button text.
- Em dashes (---) sparingly. Prefer splitting into two sentences.
- Oxford comma: yes, always.
- Ellipsis: only for truncation or loading states. Never for trailing-off tone ("Your network is growing...").

### 7.6 Talking About Competitors

Don't. Rin describes what it does. It never names, references, or implies comparison with other products. If differentiation is needed (App Store listing, website), describe Rin's approach without mentioning alternatives.

Bad: "Unlike other contact apps, Rin doesn't sell your data."
Good: "Your data stays yours. No ads. No data sales. Ever."

### 7.7 Contractions

Use them. "Don't" over "do not." "You'll" over "you will." "It's" over "it is." Natural speech, not formal writing. Exception: legal text and privacy policy.

## 9) Visual Mood References

This section describes the *feeling* of Rin's visual identity, not the specific tokens (see `IOS_DESIGN_TOKENS_V1.md` for implementation).

### 9.1 Sharp and Direct Looks Like:

- **High contrast**: Light backgrounds with dark text, or pure black backgrounds with white text. No muddy grays as primary colors. When something needs attention, the contrast ratio makes it undeniable.
- **Generous whitespace**: Density through information hierarchy, not visual clutter. Every element has room to breathe. The space between elements communicates as much as the elements themselves.
- **Minimal chrome**: No decorative borders, shadows, or gradients unless they serve an information purpose. The score ring gets a gradient because it encodes data. Cards get subtle borders because they define containment. Nothing else.
- **Monospaced accents**: Score numbers, statistics, and data points use a weight and style that reads as precise, not decorative. Numbers are data, and they should look like it.
- **Deliberate color**: Color is used for meaning — score health, component identity, circle membership, action states. It's never decorative. A screen in grayscale should still make sense; color adds a layer, not the only layer.
- **Tight typography**: SF Pro at controlled sizes. Bold for hierarchy, regular for reading. No more than three text sizes on any single screen. The type scale is a constraint, not a menu.

### 9.2 Reference Points

These products share aspects of the visual attitude Rin aims for:

| Product | What to reference |
|---------|------------------|
| **Superhuman** | Information density with clarity. Fast, keyboard-driven feel. Every pixel justified. |
| **Arc** | Opinionated design decisions. Willingness to break convention when it serves the user. |
| **Linear** | Clean data presentation. Status and priority conveyed through color and position, not decoration. |
| **Things 3** | Restraint. Beauty through simplicity and spacing, not through embellishment. |
| **Apple Health** | Data visualization that respects the user's intelligence. Scores and charts that inform without overwhelming. |

### 9.3 What Rin Does Not Look Like

- Rounded, bubbly, playful UI (not a consumer social app).
- Dense enterprise dashboards with tiny text and tab overload (not a CRM).
- Skeuomorphic or textured backgrounds (not nostalgic).
- Neon gradients or glassmorphism for its own sake (not trendy for trend's sake).

## 10) Applying This Guide

### 10.1 Copy Review Checklist

Before shipping any user-facing text, check:

1. Does every word earn its place? Cut anything removable.
2. Does it state facts or narrate feelings? Rewrite feelings as facts.
3. Is the sentence under the length limit for its context?
4. Does it contain any banned words or phrases?
5. Does it tell the user what happened and what to do next?
6. Would you say this to a sharp, busy professional sitting across from you?

### 10.2 When in Doubt

Read the copy out loud. If it sounds like a press release, rewrite it. If it sounds like something a friend who happens to be very good at their job would say, ship it.

---

## 11) Resolved Decisions

1. **First person vs. impersonal?** Impersonal. Rin is an instrument, not an assistant. "12 duplicates found" is factual. "I found 12 duplicates" implies agency and personality that conflicts with "substance over performance." Impersonal avoids the uncanny valley of a non-AI app speaking in first person. Aligns with Signal, Linear, and Superhuman patterns.

2. **Humor in Rin's voice?** No humor in v1. Humor requires trust Rin hasn't earned yet and risks undermining the "sharp, factual, professional" positioning. Revisit only if qualitative user research specifically reveals users find Rin too sterile AND humor would solve that problem. Don't add humor preemptively.

3. **Unified or split voice (marketing vs. in-product)?** Unified voice, different sentence lengths. Voice principles (every word earns its place, state facts not feelings, confident not arrogant) apply everywhere. Marketing copy allows up to 25-word sentences. In-product copy stays at 12-word max. Same voice, different density. Matches Signal, Proton, and DuckDuckGo approach.

4. **"Rin character" or tool-like?** Tool-like and impersonal. Rin is an instrument for measuring your network, not a companion. Character-driven apps (Alexa, Siri) create personality expectations that are hard to maintain and undermine trust. Aligns with Superhuman, Linear, and Things 3 reference points.
